      <description>What Is This Blog? Things I Am Not Sure About I am not sure what I will write in this blog. I have a couple ideas that I have been kicking around for a while. I am really inspired by a couple of other broad bloggers.1 I have several hobbies and a lot of interests. I would also like a place to write about some of the neat things I see when I am out and about.</description>

      <description>Brian Levin I have lived all over upstate New York. From Salamanca to Glens Falls, I have lived in almost every part of the state. Moving from town to town as a child, gave me a perspective on the uniqueness every area offers. I love food tourism (sometimes to the point of gluttony). I also, love museums of history and art and would be hard pressed to turn down a factory tour (which I drag Sarah begrudgingly through).</description>
