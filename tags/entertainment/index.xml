      <description>&lt;h1 id=&#34;opening-overture&#34;&gt;Opening Overture&lt;a class=&#34;anchor&#34; href=&#34;#opening-overture&#34;&gt;#&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;&#xA;&lt;p&gt;Recent events have me thinking about Mister Rogers. When Mister Rogers talked about giving and receiving help, he was describing something bigger than kindness. He was talking about the work of living together. After some recent stretches that tested everyone, it feels right to say this out loud. Community only thrives when we all pitch in to make it work, and it can start with something small. Check on your neighbor. Offer a hand. Give people a little grace. Step outside, touch grass, and remember that community does not survive on autopilot. We have to show up for each other, no matter the party, faith, or creed. And honestly, being kind is still easier than pretending we have it all figured out.&lt;/p&gt;</description>
