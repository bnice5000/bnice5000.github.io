Moving from town to town as a kid gave me an appreciation for how distinct each place can be. I love food tourism (sometimes to the point of gluttony), and I’m equally drawn to museums of history and art. I’m also powerless to resist a good factory tour, which I often drag Sarah through, begrudgingly on her part.\nWhen I’m not working on the Nine Ten Levin’s blog, I’m a programmer, RF technician, freelance fact enthusiast. I also have a deep love of cooking, local products, and agriculture.\nYou can reach me with suggestions, comments, or concerns at brian[at]ninetenlevins{dot}com.\nSarah Levin# Sarah was born and raised outside Corinth, New York. As a child, she discovered her love for organization and cataloging. Some kids dream of being astronauts or firefighters — Sarah wanted to be a bureaucrat. Her knack for cataloging has made this site far easier to build and maintain.\nWhen she’s not working on the site, she enjoys backpacking and hiking (often dragging Brian along). Though a bureaucrat at heart, she’s embracing her inner artist while working toward a degree in graphic design. Her passions include conservation, hiking, crafting, and baking.\nYou can reach her with suggestions, comments, or concerns at sarah[at]ninetenlevins{dot}com.\nGus Levin# Gus roared into the world on a cold winter morning, a fighter from the start at 8 lbs, 6 oz. While he occupies most of our time, he hasn’t slowed down our adventures — if anything, he’s adding to them. Thanks to him, I might finally have enough votes to start visiting more science museums.\nYou can reach him with suggestions, comments, or concerns through either of his parents’ email addresses above. He’s far too young for his own email, but he still manages to respond — mostly through crying, laughing, and farting.\nBrian, Sarah, and Gus live in the Upper Valley region of Vermont. We’d love to hear from you — drop us a line at the emails above or connect with us on social media.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/pages/games/queens-mercy/","title":"The Queen’s Mercy","section":"Games","content":"The Queen\u0026rsquo;s Mercy# “When the banners fall, every house fights alone.”\nOverview# The Queen’s Mercy is a fast, asymmetric, two-player, trick-taking card duel. Each player chooses a suit that contains 13 ranked cards plus one special card that functions as a Joker. Games are best of three rounds.\nPlayers: 2 Cards: One suit of 14 cards per player (2 to Ace plus a Joker-equivalent) Objective: Win tricks and score points to reach 10 in a round, then win two rounds to win the match Equipment and Deck Options# Each player needs one suit with 13 ranks plus a special card that behaves as the Joker. Here are some common setups:\nStandard 52-Card Deck: Each player selects a suit (♠ ♥ ♦ ♣) and adds a Joker. Heckadeck: Use the Beast (or 0) as the Joker-equivalent. Remove the other Beast (or 0) and the 11 from each suit so ranks become 2–10, J, Q, K, A, plus Beast (or 0). French Deck with Chevalier: Use the Chevalier (Knight) as the Joker-equivalent. Your suit is 2–Ace including the Chevalier. Whichever deck you use, each player must end up with 14 cards: the 13 ranks and the suit’s Joker-equivalent.\nSetup# Each player takes one full suit (2–Ace) plus the chosen Joker/Beast/Chevalier for 14 total cards. Shuffle your suit and draw three cards. Keep your own draw and discard piles separate from your opponent’s. The Queen’s Cut — Choosing Suits and Opening Lead# Use this procedure to decide suits and who leads the first trick.\nTake any one full suit with its Joker-equivalent and shuffle it. One player cuts it into two face-down halves. The other player chooses a half and flips its top card. Higher rank wins the cut. Aces are high. Jokers beat face cards but lose to numbered cards. Ties are re-cut. The winner of the cut makes a royal choice: Shape the Field: Choose which two suits will be used in this match, or Claim a Suit: Choose which of the two selected suits you will play. The other player takes the remaining decision. Shuffle your suits, draw three, and begin. Order of Play (each trick)# Select and Reveal: Both players choose a card face down, then reveal. Determine Rank Winner: Higher rank wins. Aces are high. Jokers are wild: a Joker loses to numbered cards and beats all face cards. Apply non-point effects that cancel, nullify, protect, or lock for this trick. Resolve point-changing powers using Power Resolution Order (see below). Apply base scoring: Trick winner gains +1 unless a card says otherwise. A tie gives no base point unless a card says otherwise. Discard the two played cards to their owners’ discard piles. Draw back to three cards if possible. Round End and Match Victory# A round ends when all 14 cards have been played or when any player reaches 10 points. The player with the higher total wins the round and takes one victory token. Reset both scores to zero, reshuffle each suit, and play the next round. The first player to two rounds wins the match. Scoring Rules# Base point: winner of the trick gets +1, unless replaced or prevented. Never Negative: a score cannot go below zero. Steal only if possible: you can steal points only if your foe has that many points to lose. Ties: a rank tie is neither a win nor a loss. Powers that require a win or loss do not trigger on a tie. Point Tally Tip: Use a shared pool of tokens. Take tokens when you gain points and return them when you lose points. Set aside one distinct token per round win.\nKey Terms# Deck: your face-down draw pile. Hand: the cards you currently hold. Discard: your face-up pile of played cards. Half Deck: your deck has seven or more cards. Half Discard: your discard has seven or more cards. Trick: one reveal and resolution of two cards. Round: 14 tricks in which both suits are fully played. Game / Match: best of three rounds. Trick Lead: the player whose powers resolve first when ranks are equal. The loser of the previous trick is the lead. In round one, the lead is the player who chose the suits during the Queen’s Cut. Steal: you gain the amount only if the foe can lose it. Nullify: the specified card’s power does not trigger. Locked: a locked score cannot change until the lock ends. Advantage / Disadvantage: you are ahead or behind in points. In Play: the two revealed cards of the current trick. Power Resolution Order# When both cards have powers that trigger in the same phase:\nNullify effects resolve first. Then resolve in ascending rank order: Jack, Queen, King, Ace, Joker. If both cards share the same rank, the Trick Lead resolves first. Any effect that says “next trick” waits until after all scoring for the current trick. Card Powers by Suit# ♠ Spades - Power and Pressure# Card Power Name A♠ If you lose, steal 1 if possible. Power Grab K♠ If you win, +1. If you are not ahead after scoring, -1.

Hostile Takeover Q♦ If you have Advantage before scoring, +1. If you win, +1. Momentum Trade J♦ If you lose, foe -1. Short Sell Joker♦ Next trick: both players play a random card from the foe’s hand. Each player presents a hand, and the foe chooses which card to play. Market Chaos ♣ Clubs - Balance and Control# Card Power Name A♣ If you lose or tie, +1. If your foe is at Half Deck, +2 instead. Equilibrium K♣ If you win or tie, +2. If your foe has Disadvantage, they +1. Redistribution Q♣ If you win or tie, lock foe’s score. If you lose, +1. Stasis J♣ If foe played a face this trick, nullify that power. If the trick ties, +1. Counterpoise Joker♣ Both scores become locked after discarding the played cards. Return to Balance Example Trick# Setup\nBrian plays Spades. Sarah plays Hearts. Score before the trick: Sarah 5, Brian 4 (Sarah has Advantage). Each player has three cards in hand and four in discard. Brian is the Trick Lead. Reveal\nBrian: Q♠ (Queen’s Mercy)\nSarah: A♥ (Second Wind)\nRank Winner — Ace beats Queen, so Sarah wins. Non-point effects — none. Powers (ascending rank). Q♠ checks Advantage. Brian does not have it, and Sarah is not at Disadvantage, so no effect. A♥ triggers on loss. Sarah won, so no effect. Base scoring — winner gets +1. New totals: Sarah 6, Brian 4. Discard and draw — normal. Note: Playing Q♠ while behind was a poor timing choice. The power helps only when you already lead.\nHouse Rules (Optional)# Once per round, before reveal, a player may declare the House Privilege while playing a numbered card (2–10). Each suit’s privilege may be used once per round.\nSpades — Press the Attack: If you win this trick while at Disadvantage, +1 extra. Hearts — Steadfast Heart: If you lose this trick, +1. Diamonds — Speculative Wager: After you place the card but before reveal, predict foe’s card as odd, even, or face. If correct, +2 after scoring. Clubs — Judicious Measure: Declare it before reveal. This trick’s winner does not gain the normal base +1. All other effects still apply. Strategy Notes for the Four Houses# Spades: Aggressive and momentum-driven. Push when ahead. Hearts: Thrive on attrition. Losing well can win the war. Diamonds: High variance. Lean into Advantage for explosive turns. Clubs: Control tempo with locks and nullify effects.

Each player commands one of four houses: Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, or Clubs, and every house fights in its own delightfully inconvenient way. It is part strategy, part psychology, and part watching your opponent realize that losing gracefully is sometimes the only winning move.\nIn The Queen’s Mercy, every card has an ego. The Spades are aggressive glory hounds. The Hearts play the long game, winning by losing. The Diamonds gamble like a day trader on espresso. The Clubs quietly manipulate the flow of battle until everyone else wonders who is really in charge. Rounds are fought trick by trick until one house stands triumphant, or at least smugly ahead by a single point. The game can be played with any deck, whether a standard set, a Heckadeck, or a classic French design, as long as each player can claim a full suit and one special card. The rest is mercy, luck, and timing.\nThis is not your grandfather’s bridge night. It is a knife fight in the royal courtyard disguised as a polite card game. Whether you play to crush your rival or to bask in the elegant chaos of powers colliding, The Queen’s Mercy rewards cunning over brute strength. So shuffle your suit, steel your nerves, and prepare to find out just how generous your Queen truly is.\n"}]
