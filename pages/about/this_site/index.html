<p>I’ve lived all over upstate New York, from Salamanca to Glens Falls, and just about everywhere in between. Moving from town to town as a kid gave me an appreciation for how distinct each place can be. I love food tourism (sometimes to the point of gluttony), and I’m equally drawn to museums of history and art. I’m also powerless to resist a good factory tour, which I often drag Sarah through, begrudgingly on her part.</p>
<p>When I’m not working on the Nine Ten Levin’s blog, I’m a programmer, RF technician, freelance fact enthusiast. I also have a deep love of cooking, local products, and agriculture.</p>
<p>You can reach me with suggestions, comments, or concerns at <strong>brian[at]ninetenlevins{dot}com</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="sarah-levin">Sarah Levin<a class="anchor" href="#sarah-levin">#</a></h1>
<p>Sarah was born and raised outside Corinth, New York. As a child, she discovered her love for organization and cataloging. Some kids dream of being astronauts or firefighters — Sarah wanted to be a bureaucrat. Her knack for cataloging has made this site far easier to build and maintain.</p>
<p>When she’s not working on the site, she enjoys backpacking and hiking (often dragging Brian along). Though a bureaucrat at heart, she’s embracing her inner artist while working toward a degree in graphic design. Her passions include conservation, hiking, crafting, and baking.</p>
<p>You can reach her with suggestions, comments, or concerns at <strong>sarah[at]ninetenlevins{dot}com</strong>.</p>

<h1 id="gus-levin">Gus Levin<a class="anchor" href="#gus-levin">#</a></h1>
<p>Gus roared into the world on a cold winter morning, a fighter from the start at 8 lbs, 6 oz. While he occupies most of our time, he hasn’t slowed down our adventures — if anything, he’s adding to them. Thanks to him, I might finally have enough votes to start visiting more science museums.</p>
<p>You can reach him with suggestions, comments, or concerns through either of his parents’ email addresses above. He’s far too young for his own email, but he still manages to respond — mostly through crying, laughing, and farting.</p>
<hr>
<p>Brian, Sarah, and Gus live in the Upper Valley region of Vermont. We’d love to hear from you — drop us a line at the emails above or connect with us on social media.</p>
