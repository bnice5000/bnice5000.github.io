&lt;p&gt;I just put in my application to be a &lt;a href="https://www.usajobs.gov/GetJob/ViewDetails/422461600"&gt;Foreign Service Information Management Specialist&lt;/a&gt;. I am really excited. I have always wanted to join the foreign service, but I was not interested in the generalist job activities. The Information Management Specialist matched my interest but you needed a degree in computer science or one of the approved&amp;nbsp;certifications.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I had waffled on it for years. I knew I could get one of the certifications that was required for the foreign service. I did not need a certification for my current or any of my previous jobs, so it was never a priority. This year was a bit of a roller coaster. My brother passed away and my wife is expecting our first born. I decided it was now or&amp;nbsp;never.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I signed up for the &lt;a href="https://www.isc2.org/cissp/default.aspx"&gt;&lt;span class="caps"&gt;CISSP&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/a&gt; exam in October and passed! Step one complete. After passing it was just a waiting game until they opened the application&amp;nbsp;process.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;I put in the application today. I spent a good amount of time working on the essays. I just submitted my application. I am very hopeful that I will advance in the process. Fingers&amp;nbsp;crossed!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I am not sure I will publish this blog entry. I guess it depends on my success in the application process. So, if you are reading this, I have been hired.&amp;#160;&lt;a class="footnote-backref" href="#fnref:1" rev="footnote" title="Jump back to footnote 1 in the text"&gt;&amp;#8617;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
