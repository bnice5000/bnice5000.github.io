Moving from town to town as a kid gave me an appreciation for how distinct each place can be. I love food tourism (sometimes to the point of gluttony), and I’m equally drawn to museums of history and art. I’m also powerless to resist a good factory tour, which I often drag Sarah through, begrudgingly on her part.\nWhen I’m not working on the Nine Ten Levin’s blog, I’m a programmer, RF technician, freelance fact enthusiast. I also have a deep love of cooking, local products, and agriculture.\nYou can reach me with suggestions, comments, or concerns at brian[at]ninetenlevins{dot}com.\nSarah Levin# Sarah was born and raised outside Corinth, New York. As a child, she discovered her love for organization and cataloging. Some kids dream of being astronauts or firefighters, Sarah wanted to be a bureaucrat. Her knack for cataloging has made this site far easier to build and maintain.\nWhen she’s not working on the site with me, she enjoys backpacking and hiking (often dragging Brian along begrudgingly on his part). Though a bureaucrat at heart, she’s embracing her inner artist. Felt, linoleum, and marker are her prefered mediums. Her passions include conservation, hiking, crafting, and baking.\nYou can reach her with suggestions, comments, or concerns at sarah[at]ninetenlevins{dot}com.\nGus Levin# Gus roared into the world on a cold winter morning, a fighter from the start at 8 lbs, 6 oz. While he occupies most of our time, he hasn’t slowed down our adventures. If anything, he’s adding to them. Thanks to him, I might finally have enough votes to start visiting more science museums.\nYou can reach him with suggestions, comments, or concerns through either of his parents’ email addresses above. He’s far too young for his own email.\nBrian, Sarah, and Gus are currently on an exclusive three-year tour of Europe, Scandinavia and the Subcontinent.\n"},{"id":2,"href":"/pages/games/queens-mercy/","title":"The Queen’s Mercy","section":"Games","content":"The Queen’s Mercy# “When the banners fall, every house fights alone.”**\nBy Brian Levin, Version 11.5, License: CC-BY-NC-SA\nA fast, asymmetric, two-player, trick taking, card-duel game playable with any deck.\nDeck Setup# The Queen’s Mercy can be played with several deck styles. Each suit must contain 13 ranked cards plus one special card (the Joker or equivalent). Whichever deck you choose, make sure each player’s suit contains 13 ranked cards (2-A or equivalent) and one special card functioning as the Joker.\nStandard 52-Card Deck# Use the Joker as your fourteenth card. Each player selects a suit (♠ ♥ ♦ ♣) and includes one Joker.\nHeckadeck# Use the Beast (or 0) card as your fourteenth card. Remove the other Beast/0 and the 11 card from each suit so that each has 13 ranks (2-10, J, Q, K, A, and Beast/0).\nClassic French Deck (with Chevalier)# Use the Chevalier (Knight) as the Joker equivalent. Each player’s suit becomes 2-A plus Chevalier (14 cards total).\nSetup And Play# Each player takes one full suit (2-A) plus the chosen Joker/Beast/Chevalier for a total of 14 cards. Shuffle your suit and draw three cards. Play continues until all 14 cards are played once.\nThe Queen’s Cut - Deciding Who Rules First# To determine who selects suits and who leads the opening trick, perform The Queen’s Cut:\nTake one full suit from the deck (any suit, including its Joker/Beast/Chevalier) and shuffle it thoroughly.\nOne player cuts the suit deck into two face-down halves.\nThe other player chooses one half and flips the top card face-up. The remaining player flips the top card from the other stack.\nCompare ranks: higher card wins the cut (Aces high; Jokers beat face cards but lose to numbered cards). If the revealed cards tie, reshuffle that suit and repeat the cut.\nThe higher card’s owner must make a royal choice:\nShape the Field: Decide which two suits will be used in this game. Claim a Suit: Choose the single suit you will play for this match from the two your foe has selected. The other player receives the remaining decision.\nThe Queen has spoken. Let mercy be tested. Shuffle your suit and let play begin!\nCore Play# Both players choose a card face down, then reveal. Except for Jokers, cards win in normal rank with Aces high. Jokers are wild: they lose to numbered cards but beat all face cards. Determine the trick winner by rank (or note a tie). Apply any non-point cancel or protection effects for this trick (for example, effects that turn off face powers or freeze the foe\u0026rsquo;s score). Resolve point-changing based on power resolution order noted below. Apply base scoring: the trick winner gains +1 unless a card explicitly replaces or prevents that gain. If the cards tie in rank, no base point is awarded unless a card explicitly says otherwise. Discard the played cards. Draw back up to three if possible. The round concludes when every card has been played or when a player’s score reaches 10, the fates have decided the battle. The first player to win two rounds (best of three) wins the war, their house ascends in glory. Scoring \u0026amp; Victory# At the end of each trick, total all point changes from powers and base scoring as described in Core Play. Each player’s score may never drop below zero, and points may only be stolen if the foe has points to lose (“never negative” and “steal only if possible”). After all fourteen cards in each suit have been played, the player with the higher total wins the round and earns one victory token. Reset all scores to zero before beginning the next round. The first player to win two rounds wins the match.\nPoint Tallying# Use a shared pile of poker chips, pennies, or pretzels to track points. Players take from the pile when earning points and return when losing them. Reset the pile each game. At the end of each round, the winner sets aside one token to mark a round victory. The first to two wins the match.\nKey Terms And Special Rules# Deck The stack of un-played, shuffled, face-down cards. Hand The cards currently held by a player. Discard The face-up pile of cards that have been played. Half Deck The deck pile contains seven or more cards. Half Discard The discard pile contains seven or more cards. Trick A single contest between two cards, one from each player’s hand, revealed at the same time and resolved by rank and card powers. A trick includes all effects, scoring, and discards that result from that reveal. Fourteen tricks make one round. Round A full sequence of fourteen tricks in which both players play every card in their suit once. After the fourteenth trick, both players total their scores. The higher total wins the round and earns a victory token. Game A complete match consisting of multiple rounds. The first player to win two rounds wins the game, representing their house’s rise to dominance. Trick Lead The player whose powers resolve first when both cards are of equal rank. The trick lead is the loser of the previous trick. In the first round, determine the trick lead by whomever chose the suits of play in the Queens Cut. Last Trick / End of Round After the fourteenth trick, compare totals to determine the round winner. A full match is best two out of three rounds. Steal Gain the listed amount only if the foe can lose that amount. Example: “Steal 1” makes you +1 and the foe −1, but if the foe has 0 points, no points move. Nullify The specified card’s power does not trigger or take effect. Locked A locked score cannot increase or decrease for the remainder of the current trick. At the start of the next round, all locks are automatically removed.\nAdvantage You currently lead in total points. Disadvantage You currently trail in total points. In Play The two revealed cards currently being resolved for the active trick. Never Negative A player’s score cannot drop below zero. If a card effect would reduce a player below zero, they lose nothing instead. Ties A tie occurs when both cards in play are the same rank. A tie counts as neither a win nor a loss. If a card’s power requires a win or loss, it does not resolve on a tie. Power Resolution Order When both cards have powers that trigger in the same phase, resolve them in ascending rank order, from the lowest-ranked card to the highest (Jack, Queen, King, Ace, Joker). If both cards share the same rank, resolve the Trick Lead’s card first. Any effect that says “next trick” resolves after all scoring for the current trick is complete. Nullify effects always resolve first.

Understanding each house’s rhythm is key to mastering the duel.\n♠ Spades - Power \u0026amp; Pressure# Spades thrive on aggression and momentum. Their face cards reward winning but punish hesitation, and their powers can backfire when played without advantage. Time your attacks. Spades reward decisive play once you have the lead. Use intimidation (J♠) and strong openers (K♠, A♠) to press an advantage before Hearts or Clubs can recover.\nPlaystyle: Assertive, risky, punishes weakness. Strengths: Swing turns, pressure tools. Weaknesses: Vulnerable when behind.\n♥ Hearts - Growth \u0026amp; Resilience# Hearts win by losing gracefully. Many of their powers trigger on loss or tie, turning defeat into steady progress. Survive early pressure and you will outlast your foe. Protect key powers like Shield of Compassion (Q♥) and Second Wind (A♥) until your opponent’s aggression peaks, then rebuild as they falter.\nPlaystyle: Defensive, patient, thrives in attrition. Strengths: Comebacks, self-protection. Weaknesses: Low burst potential when ahead.\n♦ Diamonds - Wealth \u0026amp; Risk# Diamonds gamble for gain. Their cards are high variance—powerful when the odds favor them, punishing when they don’t. Play to the scoreboard: Double or Nothing (A♦) and Momentum Trade (Q♦) make small leads explosive. Use Hostile Takeover (K♦) to convert wins into steals, but beware Short Sell (J♦), timing missteps can turn profit into collapse.\nPlaystyle: Calculated risk, opportunistic trading. Strengths: Huge point spikes, tempo control. Weaknesses: Volatile results, poor recovery when misplayed.\n♣ Clubs - Balance \u0026amp; Control# Clubs control the flow of the game. Their cards lock, nullify, and redistribute, preventing runaway scores while rewarding ties and stalemates. Counterpoise (J♣) and Stasis (Q♣) make Clubs the master of denial. You will not always win tricks, but you will dictate when they matter. Focus on rhythm over rank.\nPlaystyle: Reactive, methodical, manipulates momentum. Strengths: Lockdown tools, anti-snowball play. Weaknesses: Low burst scoring, demands precise timing.\nExample Trick: Step-by-Step Resolution# Setup:\nBrian plays ♠ Spades (Power \u0026amp; Pressure). Sarah plays ♥ Hearts (Growth \u0026amp; Resilience). Score before the trick: Sarah 5, Brian 4. (Sarah has advantage; Brian has disadvantage.) Each player has three cards in hand. They have four cards in discard. Brian is the lead coming into the round. Reveal:\nBrian plays Q♠ (Queen’s Mercy). Sarah plays A♥ (Second Wind). Step 1 - Determine Winner by Rank\nAce outranks Queen. Sarah wins the trick. Step 2 - Apply Non-Point, Cancel, or Protection Effects\nNone this trick (no Nullify or Lock effects are active). Step 3 - Resolve Powers (ascending rank order)\nQ♠ (Brian): “If you have advantage, gain +1; if your foe is at disadvantage, they gain +2.” Brian does not have advantage → no +1 for Brian. Sarah is not at disadvantage → no +2 for Sarah. No change in score from this power, a bad play. A♥ (Sarah): “If you lose, gain +1 (or +2 if foe half discard).” Sarah won the trick → this power does not trigger. Step 4 - Apply Base Scoring\nTrick winner gains +1. Sarah +1 → new totals: Sarah 6, Brian 4. Step 5 - Discard and Draw\nBoth played cards move to their owners’ discard piles. Each player draws back up to three cards if possible. Strategy Note:\nThis play was selected because it was an example of a strategy misfire. Brian’s choice to play the Queen of Spades while behind was risky. The Q♠ power only helps when you already have advantage, so it provided no benefit here. This example shows how timing and card selection matter as much as rank, sometimes the right card played at the wrong time yields no mercy at all.\nHouse Rules# These are rules you can add if you want to spice up game play. They have a very nominal effect on win percentages and add some additional strategy to the game once you are comfortable with it.\nHouse Privilege - Once Per Round Abilities# Once per round, before reveal, a player may declare their House Privilege while playing a numbered card (2–10). Each suit may invoke its privilege only once per round.\nSuit Privilege Effect ♠ Spades Press the Attack If you win this trick while at disadvantage, gain +1 extra point. ♥ Hearts Steadfast Heart If you lose this trick, gain +1 point. ♦ Diamonds Speculative Wager After the flop but before the reveal, predict whether your foe’s card will be odd, even, or face. If correct, gain +2 after scoring. ♣ Clubs Judicious Measure Before the reveal, declare “Judicious Measure.” This trick’s winner does not gain the normal base +1 point (all other effects still apply). v11.5 Balance Report# 10K Monte Carlo Simulation with heuristic best play.\nP1 Suit P2 Suit P1 Win % P2 Win % Tie % P1 Avg Score P2 Avg Score Spades Hearts 34.9 35.1 30.0 0.499 0.501 Spades Diamonds 37.8 34.0 28.2 0.516 0.484 Spades Clubs 31.0 36.7 32.3 0.474 0.526 Hearts Diamonds 36.1 33.8 30.1 0.507 0.493 Hearts Clubs 33.0 35.4 31.6 0.491 0.509 Clubs Hearts 31.9 36.6 31.5 0.477 Special Thanks!# To Sarah for putting up with my endless iterations and play testing. ❤️ To Kelly and Hugh for play testing and amazing feedback! 🙏\n"},{"id":3,"href":"/pages/about/sausage/","title":"The Sausage","section":"NineTenLevin's Pages","content":"The Sausage# The Engine# This site is built with Hugo, a fast and flexible static site generator written in Go.

In the spirit of National Novel Writing Month, I felt the urge to write more, but I also knew I did not have a novel in me. After some reflection, I decided committing to regular posts here for a year was the write direction.2 So here we are. My goal is one to three entries a week, a modest but earnest attempt at consistency. I will try to be interesting, or at least not boring. I will likely fail.3 It’s always harder to wobble gracefully under observation, but I am glad you chose to come along for the ride.\nLink Shotgun Blast# The Most Expensive States to Buy a Turkey This Thanksgiving (And the Least) Given supply chains being what they are, AK and HI were no surprise.

A New Lego ‘Legend of Zelda’ Set Is Coming Our household is buzzing after hearing LEGO is releasing a Legend of Zelda: Ocarina of Time set in 2026. Between our love of minifigures and Zelda, it feels like someone finally built a toy straight from our wish list, and I’m already clearing space for living room battles with Ganon. Ken Burns\u0026rsquo; \u0026lsquo;American Revolution\u0026rsquo; will make you think differently about U.S. history Ken Burns is making a documentary on the Revolutionary War, and it should be great since he always delivers something remarkable. The Civil War was unforgettable, and it feels fitting that the Revolutionary War, long overshadowed by the much better known War of 1812, will finally get its moment in the spotlight. Amanda Almira Newton, USDA Pomological Watercolor Collection (Public Domain) Podcast Pick# 🎧 Crantastic: The Story of America’s Berry The podcast of the week is an oldie but a goody. The cranberry is often relegated to a cylindrical gel on the Thanksgiving table, wobbling there like an afterthought, but this episode of Gastropod, titled “Crantastic: The Story of America’s Berry,” reminds us there’s much more to it. It digs into the berry’s deep roots in Native American traditions, its rise and fall in American cuisine, and the dubious claims about its medicinal powers. It’s the perfect pre-Thanksgiving listen, especially if you enjoy learning that the most maligned food on the table has a richer backstory than most of your dinner guests.\nFrom the Bottom of the Junk Drawer# On November 12, 1970, Oregon officials decided to clear a beached whale with dynamite, a sentence that says more about human confidence than any philosophy book ever could. The goal was to feed the seagulls. The result was an airborne meat raffle that dented cars, stunned bystanders, and made local history. It is hard to imagine a better metaphor for problem solving at scale: big idea, bad math, the hubris of man, and one unforgettable mess.\nWatch the glorious disaster: Read more from Oregon Public Broadcasting: “It was like a blubber snowstorm”\nOr the substantially less famous Seneca the Younger\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nVery punny!

Each player commands one of four houses: Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, or Clubs, and every house fights in its own delightfully inconvenient way. It is part strategy, part psychology, and part watching your opponent realize that losing gracefully is sometimes the only winning move.\nIn The Queen’s Mercy, every card has an ego. The Spades are aggressive glory hounds. The Hearts play the long game, winning by losing. The Diamonds gamble like a day trader on espresso. The Clubs quietly manipulate the flow of battle until everyone else wonders who is really in charge. Rounds are fought trick by trick until one house stands triumphant, or at least smugly ahead by a single point. The game can be played with any deck, whether a standard set, a Heckadeck, or a classic French design, as long as each player can claim a full suit and one special card. The rest is mercy, luck, and timing.\nThis is not your grandfather’s bridge night. It is a knife fight in the royal courtyard disguised as a polite card game. Whether you play to crush your rival or to bask in the elegant chaos of powers colliding, The Queen’s Mercy rewards cunning over brute strength. So shuffle your suit, steel your nerves, and prepare to find out just how generous your Queen truly is.\nMeet the Queen! Visit the game rules.\n"}]
